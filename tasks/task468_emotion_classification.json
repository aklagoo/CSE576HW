    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "i am ever feeling nostalgic about the fireplace i will know that it is still on the property",
            "output": "love",
            "explanation": "The word 'nostalgic' could either mean 'love' or 'sadness', but the fact that it is still on the property eliminates 'love'."

            "input": "i am feeling grouchy",
            "output": "anger",

            "input": "i feel romantic too",
            "output": "joy",
            "explanation": "This statement clearly indicates joy, but the joy particularly relates to romance. So, the correct label must be 'love' instead."

            "output": "love",
            "explanation": "The sentence shows a negative outlook, due the reason behind finding meaning.         So, the label should be 'sadness' and not 'love'."
